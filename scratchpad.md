# MatrixMap Development

## Current Task
Debugging and improving the MatrixMap implementation, particularly focusing on the proxy trap functionality and array operations.

## Progress
[X] Fixed keyMap property name inconsistency (_keyMap vs keyMap)
[X] Improved proxy set trap to handle edge cases (undefined values, duplicate keys)
[X] Identified issue with proxy not being triggered in createMatrixMap
[X] Moved proxy creation from MatrixMap class to createMatrixMap function
[X] Added back array methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, fill, copyWithin, sort, reverse)

## Lessons
1. When implementing a proxy-based array wrapper:
   - Ensure the proxy is created at the right level (in this case, in createMatrixMap not just MatrixMap class)
   - Be consistent with property names (keyMap vs _keyMap)
   - Handle edge cases in the set trap (undefined values, numeric vs string indices)
   - Make key-map updates conditional on successful array operations
2. Array method overrides:
   - Need to use Array.prototype methods with .call(this) to avoid infinite recursion
   - Must maintain keyMap consistency in all array-mutating operations
   - Should handle edge cases like negative indices in methods like splice, fill, copyWithin

## Next Steps
[ ] Add tests to verify proxy trap behavior
[ ] Consider adding validation for duplicate keys
[ ] Add TypeScript type definitions
[ ] Consider adding bulk operation mode to optimize performance when doing many operations
